# Maze Algorithms

## Description

This project, as its name indicates, aims to investigate a little more about algorithms, particularly when applied to mazes, both in their creation and in their resolution.
This project topic probably doesn't have much applicability in the real world, but as it was always a topic that interested me I decided to put it into practice, in order to try to deepen my knowledge on the subject a little more.
